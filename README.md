# Carbon usage tracker for Craft CMS

Carbon tracker aims to give control panel users more insights into the carbon emissions of their pages.

The plugin uses the [websitecarbon.com API](https://www.websitecarbon.com/), and will only check for new metrics once every 24 hours. **That means you won't see new metrics for every update or change you make** - as that would result in lots of API calls, defeating the purpose of keeping our footprint as small as possible 🙂.


## Requirements
This plugin requires Craft CMS 4.5.0 or later, and PHP 8.0.2 or later.

## Installation

You can install this plugin from the Plugin Store or with Composer.

#### From the Plugin Store

Go to the Plugin Store in your project’s Control Panel and search for “carbon-tracker”. Then press “Install”.

#### With Composer

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
# go to the project directory
cd /path/to/my-project.test

# tell Composer to load the plugin
composer require statikbe/craft-carbon-tracker

# tell Craft to install the plugin
./craft plugin/install carbon-tracker
```
